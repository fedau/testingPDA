### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # you need to use ==
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
      # colon after else
    else
      return False
   
# def and not dif and after card1 put a comma
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
# indent everything once with a tab
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    # return card1 not card
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# indent everyting once with a tab
def cards_total(self, cards):
  # make total a variable so total = 0
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    # return f"You have a total of {total}" and take return statement out of for loop
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
